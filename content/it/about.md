Le  About Us

endCoronavirus.org is built and maintained by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) and collaborators.  Our goal is to minimize the impact of the Coronavirus COVID-19 by providing useful data and guidelines for action.

Our research team has co-faculty, students and affiliates from MIT, Harvard, Brandeis and other universities nationally and internationally. We are working around the clock to monitor and communicate the current state of the COVID-19 epidemic.

We utilize mathematically-based approaches which transcend the boundaries of physical, biological and social sciences, as well as engineering, management, and medicine.

When not focused on COVID-19, we specialize in networks, agent-based modeling, multiscale analysis and complexity, chaos and predictability, evolution, ecology, biodiversity, altruism, systems biology, cellular response, health care, systems engineering, negotiation, military conflict, ethnic violence, and international development.
Call to Action

The Coronavirus COVID-19 is a rapidly transmitting disease that evolves in 20% of cases to require extended hospitalizations and roughly 2% of cases result in death, with risks increasing rapidly for those over 50 years old. It can transmit even with mild symptoms (coughing, sneezing, or elevated temperature) and perhaps before symptoms appear. Reducing the likelihood of transmission requires everyone to reduce their likelihood of contact not only so they aren’t infected but also so that they don’t transmit the disease to others.

Aggressive and bold actions are required to reduce transmission by minimizing close-contact interaction in order to reduce vulnerability and risk for individuals, but also to “get ahead” of the outbreak so that it is stopped.

Everyone can help. Join us by sending an email to necsivolunteers@gmail.com
