## Take part in eradicating this epidemic

Since the first confirmed case of a new, virulent strain of the coronavirus in December in Wuhan, China, the disease has spread to more than 100 countries and territories. As of March 7, 2020, there are 105,946 confirmed cases and 3,569 deaths. These numbers are still increasing.

And hereâ€™s some more about us.

## The key to stopping the spread of the virus is to lower connectivity

Every time the virus does not infect another person, it has a massive impact on reducing the growth of overall infections. The better informed we all are on the actions we can take, the better we will serve our most vulnerable loved ones and our healthcare infrastructure at large.

Without intervention, it is estimated that an individual with the virus will infect on average 3-4 other people, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of cases over time. If social connectivity can be lowered such that the average number of people that an individual with the virus infects is less than one other person, the number of cases will exponentially decrease over time instead.

Stay informed with the latest news on preventing and defeating the spread of COVID-19, written and published by experts in the field.
