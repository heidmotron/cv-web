There are many types of coronaviruses, and these commonly cause mild respiratory illnesses. COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus, and it was first discovered in Wuhan, China.</p><h3 id=-why-are-people-so-afraid-of-this-outbreak-isnt-it-just-like-the-normal-flu>+ Why are people so afraid of this outbreak, isn&rsquo;t it just like the normal flu?</h3><p>The Coronavirus causes about 20% severe cases and 2% deaths. This is about 20 times higher than the flu. A typical incubation period is 3 days but it may extend to 14 days, and reports exist of 24 and 27 days. It is highly contagious with an increase from day to day of 50% in new cases (infection rate R0 of about 3-4) unless extraordinary interventions are made.</p><h3 id=-what-are-the-symptoms-of-covid-19>+ What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h3><p>Symptoms of COVID-19 commonly include fever, coughing, and tiredness. Some patients also experience aching, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea. Most people recover from this virus without needing special treatment, but some may become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with existing medical problems like heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes, are more likely to develop severe symptoms.</p><h3 id=-what-should-i-do-if-i-believe-that-i-have-covid-19>+ What should I do if I believe that I have COVID-19?</h3><p>Begin by isolating yourself from the community. The majority of those who contract COVID-19 experience mild symptoms that can be managed home. If there are others in your household, limit contact by staying in one room and sanitize shared surfaces frequently. Wear a facemask when interacting with those in your household, and clean your hands often.</p><p>Next, arrange to be tested for COVID-19 by contacting your local health authorities. Call your local health department to notify them of your symptoms as well as your travel history and any potential points of contact that you may have had with the coronavirus. If medical attention is needed, wear a facemask and find a safe way to travel to the facility – avoid public transportation or ride share services.</p><p>Health care facilities are under a great deal of stress, so be persistent if you believe that you have COVID-19. If officials deny your request for testing, you may want to document your experiences and share this information with local news outlets and social media.</p><h3 id=-how-is-covid-19-transmitted>+ How is COVID-19 transmitted?</h3><p>COVID-19 is spread through contact with other infected individuals. The virus spreads when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales, releasing droplets into the air and onto surrounding surfaces. People can catch COVID-19 by breathing in these droplets, or by touching an infected surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. To reduce the spread of COVID-19, it is of utmost importance that everyone near affected areas take strong measures to reduce connectivity.</p><h3 id=-wont-the-outbreak-happen-no-matter-what-we-do>+ Won&rsquo;t the outbreak happen no matter what we do?</h3><p>If we reduce contact between people the rate of infection will decrease. By isolating those who are sick or are likely to become sick because of contacts they have had we can reduce the rate of new cases. When there are many cases, this is not enough. It is possible to stop the outbreak by &ldquo;locking down&rdquo; communities where there are multiple cases. If everyone stays at home for the incubation period the number of new cases is dramatically smaller. This has been done in China, South Korea and Italy. China managed to stop and reverse the growth in cases, and they are near eliminating all the cases across China. South Korea and Italy are still working to refine their interventions to achieve the same outcome.</p><h3 id=-how-can-i-protect-myself-and-others-from-this-virus>+ How can I protect myself and others from this virus?</h3><p>Begin by cleaning your hands thoroughly and frequently! Hands can pick up the coronavirus through contact with infectious droplets. Scrub hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, then rinse and dry. If soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based sanitizer can also kill viruses that are on your hands. Between hand washings, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth to keep viruses from entering your body. If someone near you is coughing or sneezing, maintain at least 3 feet of distance to avoid inhaling droplets that may contain a virus. If you are coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue. Most importantly, if you feel unwell, stay home. If you have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider to learn how to seek medical attention.</p><p>We strongly recommend reviewing our guidelines for detailed recommendations for individuals, communities, businesses, and governments.</p><h3 id=-how-is-covid-19-treated>+ How is COVID-19 treated?</h3><p>There is no anti-viral treatment for COVID-19. Because this disease is caused by a virus, antibiotics are also not effective. People with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing should seek medical care early to alleviate the symptoms and reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection.</p><h3 id=-how-can-i-prepare-my-home-and-family-for-an-outbreak-in-our-area>+ How can I prepare my home and family for an outbreak in our area?</h3><p>Talk with family and friends to create a plan of action, including steps that you can take if your workplace or your child’s school must close. Identify those who may be at greater risk for serious complications. Based on current data, older adults and those with chronic medical conditions are at the highest risk for severe symptoms. Monitor these individuals closely and seek out medical attention at the first sign of COVID-19 symptoms. Practice good personal hygiene habits, such as washing hands and avoiding contact with people who are sick, and clean frequently touched surfaces daily.</p><h3 id=-should-i-wear-a-face-mask>+ Should I wear a face mask?</h3><p>The use of masks is debated, we note that: (1) Any individual who has even mild symptoms should avoid contact with others and should wear a mask while in necessary public or private contact with others. (2) Wearing a mask should be accepted in public settings to prevent those who are sick from hesitating to or feeling stigmatized by wearing a mask. (3) While masks do not guarantee safety for a healthy individual and their availability may be limited because of higher priority need in medical settings, using masks where proximity to others who may be infected can’t be avoided dramatically reduces the risk of infection. (4) For those who are over 50 or have preexisting health conditions, as well as for those in areas of heightened risk, the large cost of being infected justifies the use of a mask.</p><h3 id=-will-warm-weather-stop-the-outbreak>+ Will warm weather stop the outbreak?</h3><p>This is an idea that was suggested online and has attracted attention. There is no evidence that this is the case.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-12><div class=footer-inner><h3 class=footer-title>End Coronavirus</h3><ul><li class=menu-item-home><a href=/>Home</a></li><li class=menu-item-contact><a href=/contact/>Contact</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class=sub-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-12><div class=sub-footer-inner><ul><li><strong>Email: </strong><a href=mailto:></a></li></ul><a class=zerostatic href=https://www.zerostatic.io>www.zerostatic.io</a></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/js/scripts.min.bf1e1f7ae8e03db5f012356e825843facdff51c0a559cb0d27fe2bbe1db405c2.js></script><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato&display=swap" rel=stylesheet></body></html>
